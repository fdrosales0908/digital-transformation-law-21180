    "text": "1 Summary\nThe results show a public sector with unequal digital capacity. Institutions vary a lot in size, and staffing levels are much lower in regional and municipal organizations. However, in all institution types, internal IT capacity is limited: the median share of IT staff is only 1–2% of total employees. This constraint is more serious in municipalities, where there is also a human capital gap: around half of IT staff do not have training directly related to IT.\nTogether, these patterns reduce the operational sustainability of digital transformation (development, maintenance, security, and interoperability), especially in territorial institutions.\nOn the regulatory side, Law 21,180 has promoted gradual progress since 2019. But implementation looks more instrumental than strategic: adoption is higher for mandatory tools like electronic signature, while more complex components—electronic document management, platform modernization, and institutional implementation plans—show delays.\nThere is also still low maturity in data governance. Even though data anonymization shows relevant progress, institutionalization is limited (few formal strategies, responsible units, and consistent open data policies). This restricts the strategic use of information for decisions and digital public services. In short, the impact of Law 21,180 is still shaped by structural gaps in staffing, skills, and governance, especially in smaller and territorial institutions."

    "text": "2 Introduction\nLaw 21,180 on Digital Transformation of the State aims to digitalize the full cycle of administrative procedures, improving efficiency, traceability, and transparency. Its implementation has been progressive since 2019, recognizing that institutions have different capacities.\nFrom March 1, 2024, the Digital Government Secretariat (SGD) in the Ministry of Finance has a central role in proposing the Digital Government strategy and coordinating its implementation.\nThis report uses data from the Digital Government Indicators Study 2023 (reference year 2022) to describe gaps and progress in key dimensions of digital transformation, comparing results by institution type.\nThe goal is to analyze how prepared public institutions in Chile are—by institutional type—to sustain digital transformation, and in which dimensions the main gaps appear."

The dataset also includes values coded as #s.i. (no information) and #n.a. (not applicable), especially in staffing and technology infrastructure variables.\nThese values were recoded as missing data (NA) to ensure correct interpretation of indicators and to avoid distortions in descriptive analysis. For proportional indicators, we used only observations with valid information, without imputing missing values."

    "text": "4 Descriptive results by dimension\n\n4.1 Dimension 1: Institutional profile\nTotal staff size is highly heterogeneous across institution types. This matters when interpreting implementation capacity and comparing institutions.\nOverall, the institutional ecosystem is very unequal in size, which directly affects the ability to build internal and specialized technology teams.\n\n\nCode\np_tamano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Dimension 2: IT capacity (share of IT staff)\nWe analyze the percentage of IT staff relative to total staff as a proxy for installed capacity to sustain digital transformation. International literature highlights that without internal capacity (and training plans), digital transformation may remain a “project”, with strong external dependence and limited sustainability.\nKey results:\n\nAcross all institution types, the median is around 1% to 2%.\nCentral Government: higher median (≈2%) and higher dispersion (cases close to 6%).\nHigher Education: similar levels, concentrated around 2%.\nMunicipalities: lower median (≈1–1.5%) and strong concentration at low values.\nRegional level: lowest share, with many cases close to 0%.\n\nIn short, even in large institutions, IT is still a small part of total staff, limiting development, maintenance, security, and interoperability.\n\n\nCode\np_prop_ti\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Dimension 3: IT staff training\nWe measure the percentage of IT staff with related training (non-university ICT + university science/technology). Academic research on public sector digital transformation shows that human capacities—leadership, technical skills, and governance—are key success factors, especially at territorial level.\nMain findings:\n\nRegional level: high median (≈80–90%), with important dispersion.\nCentral Government: medium-high values (≈70–80%).\nHigher Education: concentrated around ≈60–70%.\nMunicipalities: lowest levels, medians close to 50%.\n\nValues above 100% appear in some cases, suggesting inconsistencies in reporting or occupational classification.\nTherefore, there is a clear gap in specialized training, particularly in municipalities, which may affect interoperability, security, system development, and data governance.\nFrom the previous points, we observe three main gaps: institutional size, technology staffing, and capabilities.\n\n\nCode\np_formacion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData quality note. Some institutions reported a number of IT staff with related training higher than their total IT staff. To avoid distortion, values above 100% were capped at 100% and flagged as inconsistent records.\n\n\n4.4 Dimension 4: Regulatory implementation of Law 21,180\nWe summarize key instruments linked to implementation: institutional plan, advanced electronic signature, document management, and platform improvement. Law 21,180 sets the framework for digital administrative procedures and its progressive rollout across OAE institutions.\nObserved pattern:\n\nHigh adoption of mandatory and cross-cutting tools → electronic signature\nPartial progress in structural components → document management / platforms\nWeak strategic institutionalization → formal implementation plans\n\nOverall, the results suggest that implementation has been more instrumental than organizational, and strongly shaped by internal capacities (staffing, skills, and governance).\n\n\nCode\np_ley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Dimension 5: Technology infrastructure\nWe evaluate availability of: fiber connection, VPN, own data center, external data center, and technical software guidelines.\nGeneral results:\n\nBasic connectivity (fiber optic): high and relatively homogeneous (an enabling base).\nAdvanced infrastructure: relevant gaps, especially in municipalities (VPN, standards, external data centers).\nCentral government and higher education show higher levels of infrastructure and standards, reflecting stronger investment and management capacity.\n\nIn conclusion, improvements in connectivity coexist with delays in components needed for secure, integrated, and sustainable operation. This directly affects effective implementation of Law 21,180.\n\n\nCode\np_infra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Dimension 6: Open data and data governance\nWe analyze open data publication, existence of a data strategy, anonymization, and the presence of a data management unit.\nMain results:\n\nData anonymization: strongest cross-cutting progress (especially municipalities and central government).\nFormal data management unit: medium levels, mainly in central government and higher education.\nInstitutional data strategy: very low overall; almost absent in municipalities and regional institutions.\nOpen data publication: partial progress, with territorial lag.\n\nAs a result, we see progress driven by regulatory demands (e.g., anonymization), but there is still a structural deficit in strategies, responsible units, and formal governance.\n\n\nCode\np_datos"

The gaps are explained by structural factors: institutional size, infrastructure availability, IT staffing and specialization, and the ability to plan and govern.\nIn this context, Law 21,180 has generated important regulatory progress, but its impact on institutional digital maturity is still shaped by organizational limits and technical capacity constraints, especially in smaller and territorial institutions."
